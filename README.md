## Getting Started

First, click the button below to fork the repo on replit.

<a target=”_blank" href="https://replit.com/github/P-DennyGamingYT/PD-AI“><img alt=“Run on Replit” src=”https://binbashbanana.github.io/deploy-buttons/buttons/remade/replit.svg“></a>

After forking the repo, create a secret with the name "OPENAI_API_KEY" and set the value to your Open AI API key.
To get your API key, go to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" target="_blank">OpenAI Account API Keys</a> page and then click the "Create new secret key" button.

After inputting your API key, hit the run button to start the development server.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on `/api/chat`. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/chat.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
